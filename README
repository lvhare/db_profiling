= DB Profiling

A simple database query profiling tool, basis of Aaron Patterson's blog:
http://tenderlovemaking.com/2008/03/13/profiling-database-queries-in-rails/
Honor to him, bug to me
 
== Installation

The recommended way is that you get the gem:

gem install quake-db_profiling --source http://gems.github.com/
 
== Example usage

add one line to environment.rb:

require 'db_profiling' if RAILS_ENV == "development"

add helper output to the view which you want to profiling, for example, layouts/application.rhtml:

<%= db_profiling_view if RAILS_ENV == "development" %>
